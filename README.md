# C Compiler for C64 Turbo Assembler
This project is a C compiler that generates assembly code compatible with the C64 Turbo Assembler. It is designed to facilitate the development of C programs for the Commodore 64 by translating C source code into assembly language that can be assembled and run on the C64 platform.

## Features
- Supports a subset of the C programming language.
- Generates assembly code compatible with C64 Turbo Assembler.
- handmade for educational purposes
- and to help me write C64 programs in Turbo Assembler

# TODO:
[ ] finish parser to start playing with AST tree
[ ] explore recursive descent parsing
[ ] finish writing zig tests for parts of code that are done
[ ] integrate zig build system to build the project instead of using a Makefile
[ ] write documentation
[ ] explore how to represent int, long, etc in 8-bit memory
[ ] explore turbo assembly tricks and hacks
